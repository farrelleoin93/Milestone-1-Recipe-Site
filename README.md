### Fonts

When I started this project I had intended on using [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto)
 for the headings and navbar links. I also had planned on using [Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito?query=nunito) 
for the paragraphs. However, I was unhappy with how these fonts looked so I decided to use [Domine](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Domine?query=domine) for the headings and the navbar links.
I then used [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) for the paragraphs.

### Colours

- Originally for the header and footer I was planning on using a green as it reminded me of fresh ingrdients which I felt was fitting for a recipe website.
However, I was not happy with how it looked so I instead decided to go with a maroon to match the marroon coloured salad leaves in the main image on the home page.
- To contrast this I chose white #fff for the background colour of the body.
- I also used white #fff for the font in the header and footer as I felt it worked well with the shade of maroon that I used.
- For the headings and paragraphs in the main body I used a grey #545b62.

### Icons

The icons that I used in this project were provided by [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

### Original Wireframes

The original wireframes from before I started to build my website can be found at the following links:

- [Home Page](https://github.com/farrelleoin93/Milestone-3-Recipe-Site/blob/master/assets/docs/Home-page-wireframes.pdf)

- [Recipe Choice Page](https://github.com/farrelleoin93/Milestone-3-Recipe-Site/blob/master/assets/docs/Recipe-choice-page.pdf)

- [Recipe Pages](https://github.com/farrelleoin93/Milestone-3-Recipe-Site/blob/master/assets/docs/Recipe-page.pdf)

- [Contact](https://github.com/farrelleoin93/Milestone-3-Recipe-Site/blob/master/assets/docs/Contact-page.pdf)

#### Changes to Original Wireframes

- All Pages
  - The page links in the footer were removed. Since the header was fixed to the top there was no need to have these links in the footer. This change came from advice I recieved from my mentor Akshat Garg.
- Home Page
  - "Famished" text box was added to the center of the hero image as the page looked a bit plain without it. This change came from advice I recieved from my mentor Akshat Garg.
  - Hero image was included on mobile device. This was a result of advice I recieved on my post in peer-code-review on slack from Alexeykuz and Liga.
- Recipe Pages
  - The ingredients and Instructions sections were stacked on top of eachother on desktops as It appeared more balanced than it did side by side. This change came from advice I recieved from my mentor Akshat Garg.

## <a name="testing">Testing</a>

---

1. All html pages were passed through [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) and the results are as follows:
     - *index.html* - "Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show."
     - *contact.html* - "Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show."
     - *starter-recipes.html* - "Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show."
     - *mains-recipes.html* - "Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show."
     - *desserts-recipes.html* - "Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show."

         When I first passed the rest of the html pages through the validator they all had the same three errors show up as they all use the same template since they are the recipe pages.
         The errors that shoed up are as follows:
     1. "Error: Bad value 80% for attribute width on element img: Expected a digit but saw % instead."
     2. "Error: Bad value auto for attribute height on element img: Expected a digit but saw a instead."
     3. "Error: No p element in scope but a p end tag seen."

         I then made the appropriate changes and passed the pages through the validator again and the results were as follows:
     - bagels.html - "Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show."
     - brownies.html - "Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show."
     - cheesecake.html - "Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show."
     - cookies.html - "Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show."
     - curry.html - "Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show."
     - dumplings.html - "Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show."
     - meatballs.html - "Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show."
     - pasta.html - "Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show."
     - rings.html - "Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show."

2. The style.css file was passed through [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) and got the result: "Congratulations! No Error Found."

3. I used the Lighthouse function in DevTools and following the results  I used [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) to reduce the size of all images to improve the speed of my webiste.
Although It also suggested that my colouring scheme was not contrasting enough I decided to not change this as I am happy with the overall look of the website.

4. Further Testing
  - This site was tested on the following browsers: Google Chrome. Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer and Safari.
  - This website was tested on multiple devices, including: Desktop, iPad, iPhone 5/6/7/8/X, Samsung Galaxy S5.
  - I also asked my friends to test out my the websie and report any bugs that they found.
  - All links were tested.
  - I applied Unicorn Revealer to all pages.

5. User Stories
     - *As a user, I want to understand what the site is for.* - I feel that this was achieved by the us of the hero image on the hom page and the brief description below this image. 
     - *As a user, I want to be able to easily find recipes to cook matching my ability in the kitchen.* - I feel that this was achieved by choosing recipes of different difficulty to feature on the site.

     - *As a user, I want to be able to find recipes that I have seen on the site in the past.* - I feel that this was achieved by placing all recipes in pages that are labelled as the type of course that matches them.
     - *As a user, I want to be able to contact the owner of the website.* - I feel that this was achieved by the form on the contact us page.

6. Site Owner Goals

1. When I first passed the recipe pages through he HTML validator I got the following errors:
     - "Error: Bad value 80% for attribute width on element img: Expected a digit but saw % instead."
     This was solved by creating a div element and applying the width value in the style.css file instead.
     - "Error: Bad value auto for attribute height on element img: Expected a digit but saw a instead."
     This was solved by creating a div element and applying the width value in the style.css file instead.
     - "Error: No p element in scope but a p end tag seen."
     This was solved by replacing the p element with a div.

2. I had a small bit of horizontal scroll on my pages, this was solved by by using Unicorn Revealer to find some unwanted margins.
